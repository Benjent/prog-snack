        <h2>Hi!</h2>
    
        <p>
            Would You Like A Snack is a tiny web project with big music ambitions: dusting old prog albums, known as prog gems, to make them shine beside classic albums.
        </p>
        <p>
            Prog albums are anything related to progressive music, from late 60's psychedelic vibes to early 80's electronic wave ; still focusing on the progressive bloom of the 70's and not going further than 1965-1995.
        </p>
        <p>
            This project is designed as a tool to discover albums, the way we would pick up vinyls in music stores, as well as centralizer of what can be found scrapping the web.
        </p>
        <p>
            Each week, I try to grow the collection with more albums if I manage to find information and the time to listen to them.
